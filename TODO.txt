List of todo items:
- figure out if it's possible to move the text.style lines to css, and import them from there --> makes code more readable
- migrate code to updateBar()
- add functionality to remove assignment

- possible: maybe find a place to store deadlines in local memory, so that they may be accessed even after the page is reloaded.
